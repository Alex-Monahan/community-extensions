  extended_description: |
    The `shellfs` extension for DuckDB enables the use of Unix pipes for input and output.
    By appending a pipe character `|` to a filename, DuckDB will treat it as a series of commands
    to execute and capture the output. Conversely, if you prefix a filename with `|`, DuckDB will
    treat it as an output pipe.
